# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First day at Tech Talent South (TTS) for iOS Development

**Thoughts:** On the first day, we had basic introductions and were introduced to the basics of Swift

**Link to work:** N/A at this time. 

### Day 1: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Second day at TTS. We were introduced to loops, if else statements, and switch statements

**Thoughts**: So far, I'm really liking the language. Very simple and straight forward but it does require much
thought into the development process for producing clean code. I did learn that the order in which you write a particular
block of code is very important. We were assign homework from lesson 2. 

**Link(s) to work**: Will include a link to work from homework 2.


### Day 2: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Third day at TTS. 

**Thoughts** TBD.
